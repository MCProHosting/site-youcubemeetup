Building the Site
--

Node.js and NPM must be installed first.

 1. If you do not have Bower and Grunt installed globally yet, run `npm install -g grunt-cli bower`.
 2. For your first build, with the current working directory set to this project directory, run `npm install && bower install` to install necessary dependencies.
 3. Run `grunt`, again with the current working directory set to this project directory. This will compile all assets without any minification. You can alternately run `grunt dist` to run the site, minifying HTML, CSS, Javascript, images, etc. This may take several minutes to run.

Pull Requests

All pull requests are welcomed and will be examined for modification to the website.
